# Next.js Dynamic Route Data Fetching Error

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when working with dynamic routes and data fetching in Next.js. The problem stems from incorrect handling of asynchronous operations and data transformations within `getStaticPaths` and `getStaticProps`.

## Problem

The original code (bug.js) fetches data from an external API, but it incorrectly handles potential errors during the data fetching process. The data transformation is also prone to errors. This may lead to incomplete or incorrect data being used to generate the pages, resulting in 404 errors or incorrect content display.

## Solution

The solution (bugSolution.js) addresses the issue by robustly handling asynchronous operations using `async/await`, and implements comprehensive error handling.  It also validates and sanitizes the received data to prevent incorrect data transformation, improving the overall reliability of page generation.
