In Next.js, a relatively uncommon error arises when using server-side props or getStaticProps with dynamic routes and encountering issues with data fetching or route generation. This often manifests as unexpected behavior or runtime errors where the necessary data isn't available on the client-side, or the route generation process fails unexpectedly, especially with complex data structures or external API interactions.  For instance, an incorrect use of `getStaticPaths` may lead to missing pages or incorrect page generation, resulting in 404 errors or incorrect content.  The issue might involve unexpected data formats from external sources, incorrect handling of promises and asynchronous operations, or subtle issues in the data mapping and processing between the server and client components.
